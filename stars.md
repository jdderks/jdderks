Here's what the proficiency / familiarity stars mean to me:

  - ★★★★★ - Extremely profficient and familliar enough to make almost anything.
  - ★★★★☆ - Very profficient and familliar enough to make most things. (Might be at the cost of some time)
  - ★★★☆☆ - Profficient & familiar enough that I have worked with it in the past and had success with it.  
  - ★★☆☆☆ - Somewhat profficient, I've either worked with this in the past a long time ago or only worked with it a couple times at all.
  - ★☆☆☆☆ - Profficient enough to take up again but I will most likely be rusty, worked with it either long ago and not often.

These stars are a bit abstract but hopefully with this explanation it's a bit more clear what I mean with them.
